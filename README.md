Before you read, Please checkout xqill275's fork of my project, they have a great working example posted there. I plan on working on this at somepoint to better learn C++ and such I just don't have
much time at the current time.

# Algorithm-Room-Hallway-Generator
A generator used for making a 2D map of hallways and rooms all connected together. Planning to make this into multiple algorithms for different applications.

VERY WIP AND don't have as much time recently to work on it.
